This project is a website connected to the stream of data gathered and processed by the project momentum-core (https://github.com/brenes/momentum-core) and shows which users have been the most influential ones in the last hour.

Ranking algorithm has been described in the paper "De retibus socialibus et legibus momenti" by Daniel Gayo-Avello, David J. Brenes, Diego Fernández-Fernández, María E. Fernández-Menéndez and Rodrigo García-Suárez. This paper is published as a preprint on arXiv (http://arxiv4.library.cornell.edu/abs/1012.2057v1).

WARNING: This projects does not implement the ranking algorithm described on the paper, it's just a read-only website which shows the results produced and stored by the momentum-core project.
